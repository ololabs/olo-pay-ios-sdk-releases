/// Protocol to hook into important events in the ApplePay flow
///
/// __Required:__ Implement `applePaymentMethodCreated`to get payment method details that need to be submitted to Olo's Ordering API when submitting a basket with OloPay
///
/// __Optional:__ Implement `applePaymentCompleted` to know when the ApplePay sheet is dismissed
@objc public protocol OPApplePayContextDelegate: NSObjectProtocol {
    /// Called after the customer has authorized ApplePay and a payment method has been created.  Implement this method to pass the payment method ID to Olo's Ordering API
    /// when submitting a basket. If the API call returns an error, return that error so the ApplePay payment sheet can be dismissed appropriately
    /// - Parameters:
    ///     - paymentMethod: The PaymentMethod that represents the customer's Apple Pay payment method.
    /// - Returns: nil if basket submission was successful, or an Error from Olo's Ordering API if submission was unsuccessful
    @objc func applePaymentMethodCreated(_ context: OPApplePayContextProtocol, didCreatePaymentMethod paymentMethod: OPPaymentMethodProtocol) -> NSError?
    
    /// Called after the Apple Pay sheet is dismissed with the result of the payment.
    /// Your implementation could stop a spinner and display a receipt view or error to the customer, for example.
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - status:     The status of the payment
    ///   - error:      The error that occurred, if any. This will generally be `OPError`. If the error has an `errorType` of `cardError` it will also contain a user-friendly message
    ///                 that can be used to help the user understand why the payment couldn't be completed.

/// A helper class that implements and simplifies ApplePay.
///
/// Use of this class looks like this:
/// 1. Create a button for ApplePay and connect it to a click handler
/// 2. Enable/Disable or Hide/Show the ApplePay button by calling `OloPayAPI.deviceSupportsApplePay()`
/// 3. In the click handler, do the following
///     1. Check the device supports ApplePay
///     2. Create a `PKPaymentRequest` describing the request (amount, line items, etc)... An easy way to do this is to use the `OloPayAPI.createPaymentRequest(...)` helper function
///     3. Initialize this class with the payment request from the previous step
///     4. Call presentApplePay() to present the Apple Pay sheet and begin the payment process
/// 4. Implement `OPApplePayContextDelegate.applePaymentMethodCreated(...)` to submit the basket to Olo's Ordering API
/// 5. Optionally implement `OPApplePayContextDelegate.applePaymentCompleted(...)` to handle success and error states when the ApplePay sheet is dimissed
///
/// - Important: Create a new instance of this class for every payment request
/// - Warning: OPApplePayContext needs to be created as a  class member variable rather than a variable with function scope or else it can become
///            `nil` while the ApplePay sheet is presented and callback methods won't get called
///
/// __Example Implementation__
/// ```
/// class ViewController: UIViewController, OPApplePayContextDelegate {
///     // This needs to be a class member variable or it can go out of
///     // scope during the ApplePay flow and become nil, preventing callbacks
///     // from executing
///     var _applePayContext: OPApplePayContextProtocol? = nil
///
///     // Called when user taps on ApplePay button to begin ApplePay flow
///     func submitApplePay() {
///         let api: OloPayAPIProtocol = OloPayAPI() //This can be mocked for testing purposes
///         guard api.deviceSupportsApplePay() else {
///             return
///         }
///
///         do {
///             let pkPaymentRequest = try api.createPaymentRequest(forAmount: 2.99, inCountry: "US", withCurrency: "USD")
///             _applePayContext = OPApplePayContext(paymentRequest: pkPaymentRequest, delegate: self) //This can be mocked for testing purposes
///             _applePayContext?.presentApplePay() {
///                 // Optional logic for when the ApplePay flow is displayed
///             }
///         }
